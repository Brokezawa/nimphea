# Nimphea Examples

This repository contains a collection of examples for the Nimphea Nim wrapper for the Daisy Audio Platform.

## Structure

Each example is a standalone Nim project located in the `examples/` directory.

## How to Build and Flash

To build and flash an example, you should have Nimphea installed via Nimble:

```bash
nimble install nimphea
```

Then, navigate to the example directory:

```bash
cd examples/blink
nimble make
nimble flash # Via USB DFU
# OR
nimble stlink # Via ST-Link probe
```
